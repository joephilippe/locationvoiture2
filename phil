          whereas the term climate change only refers to those variations that persist for a longer period of time, 
          typically decades or more. In addition to the general meaning in which "climate change" may refer to any 
          time in Earth's history, the term is commonly used to describe the current climate change now underway. 
          In the time since the Industrial Revolution, the climate has increasingly been affected by human 
          activities that are causing global warming and climate change.

giCaching your GitHub password in Git
If you're cloning GitHub repositories using HTTPS, you can use a credential helper to tell Git to remember
your GitHub username and password every time it talks to GitHub.
Turn on the credential helper so that Git will save your password in memory for some time. By default, Git
will cache your password for 15 minutes.
Tip: You need Git 1.7.10 or newer to use the credential helper.
In Terminal, enter the following:
$ git config --global credential.helper cache
# Set git to use the credential memory cache
1
To change the default password cache timeout, enter the following:
$ git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'
# Set the cache to timeout after 1 hour (setting is in seconds)1~
