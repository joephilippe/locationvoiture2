giCaching your GitHub password in Git
If you're cloning GitHub repositories using HTTPS, you can use a credential helper to tell Git to remember
your GitHub username and password every time it talks to GitHub.
Turn on the credential helper so that Git will save your password in memory for some time. By default, Git
will cache your password for 15 minutes.
Tip: You need Git 1.7.10 or newer to use the credential helper.
In Terminal, enter the following:
$ git config --global credential.helper cache
# Set git to use the credential memory cache
1
To change the default password cache timeout, enter the following:
$ git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'
# Set the cache to timeout after 1 hour (setting is in seconds)1~
